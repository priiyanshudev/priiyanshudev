### Hi there 👋

My name is **Priyanshu**, a developer and electronics engineering student from India. I've been writing code since 8th grade — started with Python, and it's been a consistent part of my life since. I'm currently in my first year of Electronics & Communication Engineering, balancing coursework with a genuine interest in building things.

I work mostly with **C++, JavaScript, HTML, CSS**, and have a solid foundation in **Data Structures & Algorithms** and **System Design** (both high-level and low-level). I've solved 400+ problems on LeetCode. Right now I'm picking up **Java and React**, and Rust is next on the list.

Beyond writing code, I enjoy **designing things** — the visual side of building has always interested me as much as the technical side. I run Ubuntu Linux as my daily driver and have for the past three years.

When I'm not coding, I'm probably watching my cat do something weird, or slowly working through a German lesson.

I'm currently not shipping projects publicly — exams first. But I post everything I learn and build on [twitter](https://twitter.com/priyanshudevs) as it happens.
